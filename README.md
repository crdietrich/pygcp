# PyGCP: Python Methods for Google Cloud Platform
A collection of shortened methods to speed up analytical work on GCP, with an emphasis on integration with Pandas workflows. This is done two ways:  
1. Complete docstrings available to interactive sessions
2. Where possible, arguments are core Python types

## Documentation  
Documentation and Examples are at: https://github.com/crdietrich/pygcp-docs  

## Usage  
This package does not attempt to cover every GCP function, only the most common used by analytics work. For all available Google Python libraries and complete API support use the official Google packages:
